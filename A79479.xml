            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, divers Letters of godly Miniſters and Citizens of Oxford, ear and eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, written from thence, coming to my hand, of a publike Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Diſputation in Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> the Univerſity-Church, between Maſter <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:160126:3"/>a Member of the Aſſembly, and Maſter <hi>Erbury</hi> a great Sectary, on Munday the eleventh of January, 1646. I thought it good for thy benefit, to publiſh the ſum and ſubſtance of them, that thou maiſt ſee how God hath left the Independents and Sectaries (this man being within theſe few yeers a famous Independent) and to what a height they advance, both for damnable Errours, and of confidence to maintain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in one of the Univerſities, in the moſt publike place, before many hundreds, ſuch damnable Hereſies, and that in the time of a Parliament ſitting, and to the faces of ſuch Miniſters as were ſent down by them to prepare the way for the Reformation of that Univerſity. Maſter <hi>Cheynell</hi> being chalenged by ſome of Maſter <hi>Erbury</hi>'s fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to meet him at Saint <hi>Maries</hi> on Munday, Jan. 11. could do no leſſe (for many Reaſons) then come; where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Erbury</hi> maintained theſe Ten follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſitions.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:160126:3"/>
            <p n="1">I. That all the fulneſſe of the Godhead, the ſame fulneſſe of the Godhead which is in Chriſt, dwells in the Saints in the ſame meaſure, though not in the ſame manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it doth in Chriſt; and that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſhall be manifeſted in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and meaſure in the Saints, as it is in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Saints have a more glorious power then Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12. and do greater works then ever Chriſt did.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The manifeſtation of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our fleſh, is God the Son.</p>
            <p n="4">IIII. The holy Ghoſt is the power of God, or rather the coming forth of this power.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Father is the Godhead.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The Prophets ſpake more clearly of Chriſt then the Apoſtles; only the Prophets did not underſtand what they delivered.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>John</hi> the Divine ſpoke cleerly, but the Book was ſealed, which contained the myſterie of Chriſt, and no man could open it; yet Maſter <hi>Erbury</hi> preſumed to tell us what was in it: but it did appear that his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160126:4"/>Revelation was not from heaven, but <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> that hee took the Scriptures in the ſame ſenſe, and cited them in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they were taken and cited in <hi>Volke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and the Socinian Chatechiſme.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. God the Father is God of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the true God, greater then all, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The Saints have the ſame Worſhip, Honour and Glory given to them that is given unto Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Ergo</hi> The Saints are the onely Preachers. God ſpeaks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, becauſe God dwels onely in them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That when Chriſt came to take fleſh of the Virgin, hee did not take the Humane nature. Hee dreams that Chriſt was man before the world was; and ſo, though hee came to be made of a woman, hee came not to be made man, but to be made Fleſh.</p>
            <p>The contrary truths were maintained, explained, and cleerly proved by Maſter <hi>Cheynell</hi> againſt him, and that before a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160126:4"/>great Audience. The Diſpute continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt four hours; Maſter <hi>Cheynell</hi> had generall approbation: and the truth was readily embraced with ſhouting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, for which let God have all the glory. 'Tis hoped the Honourable Houſes of Parliament will not ſuffer a man to draw away the people, as he hath done (under the ſpecious name of Saints and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, and with ſtrange myſterious Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture) already very many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially women; but will proceed effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually againſt him, and make him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all other Sectaries, both for his damnable errours, and unparallell'd bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſo open a manner and place main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them.</p>
